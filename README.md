# Schoola
### This is a showcase project where the objective was to practice the basics of working with data and the logic behind a login system.

> In this prototype, I collect the user's full name, generate a username from it, perform data verifications (such as passkey and account access verification), and redirect the user to a YouTube video.

#### FYI: This was my second independent practice project. It was originally developed in August 2024, improved, and pushed in February 2025!
